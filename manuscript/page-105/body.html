And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,
Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,
Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,
'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:
Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,
When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:
Enter Desdemona and aemilia.</p><p>If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:

Your dinner, and the generous Islanders
By you inuited, do attend your presence</p><p>Oth. I am too blame</p><p>Des. Why do you speake so faintly?
Are you not well?
Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere</p><p>Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.
Let me but binde it hard, within this houre
It will be well</p></div> </div>
