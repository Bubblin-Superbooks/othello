Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,

For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands
Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)

For euery Minute is expectancie
Of more Arriuancie.
Enter Cassio.</p><p>Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,
That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens
Giue him defence against the Elements,
For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mon. Is he well ship'd?
