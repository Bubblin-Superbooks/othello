Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.
Enter.</p><p>Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.
Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moore,
My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,
(For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)
That she reserues it euermore about her,
To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,
And giu't Iago: what he will do with it
Heauen knowes, not I:
I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.
Enter Iago.</p><p>Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?
Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you</p><p>Iago. You haue a thing for me?
It is a common thing-
Aemil. Hah?
Iago. To haue a foolish wife.
Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now
For that same Handkerchiefe</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Iago. What Handkerchiefe?
Aemil. What</p></div> </div>
