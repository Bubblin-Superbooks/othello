When your eyes rowle so.
Why I should feare, I know not,
Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare</p><p>Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes</p><p>Des. They are Loues I beare to you</p><p>Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st</p><p>Des. That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame:
These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me</p><p>Oth. Peace, and be still</p><p>Des. I will so: What's the matter?
Oth. That Handkerchiefe
Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio</p><p>Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,
And aske him</p></div> </div>
