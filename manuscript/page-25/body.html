To answere this your charge?
Bra. To Prison, till fit time
Of Law, and course of direct Session
Call thee to answer</p><p>Othe. What if I do obey?
How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,
Whose Messengers are heere about my side,
Vpon some present businesse of the State,
To bring me to him</p><p>Officer. 'Tis true most worthy Signior,
The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,
I am sure is sent for</p><p>Bra. How? The Duke in Counsell?
In this time of the night? Bring him away;
Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,
Or any of my Brothers of the State,
Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:
For if such Actions may haue passage free,
Bond-slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be.</p><p>Exeunt.</p><p>Scaena Tertia.</p><p>Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.</p></div> </div>
