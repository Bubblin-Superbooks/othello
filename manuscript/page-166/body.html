And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Euery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo,
He calles me to a restitution large
Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,
As Guifts to Desdemona.
It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,
He hath a dayly beauty in his life,
That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore
May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:
No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.
Enter Cassio.</p><p>Rod. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest</p><p>Cas. That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,
But that my Coate is better then thou know'st:
I will make proofe of thine</p><p>Rod. Oh, I am slaine</p><p>Cassio. I am maym'd for euer:
Helpe hoa: Murther, murther.
Enter Othello.</p></div> </div>
