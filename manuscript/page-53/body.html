As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,
You would haue enough</p><p>Des. Alas: she ha's no speech</p><p>Iago. Infaith too much:
I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.
Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
And chides with thinking</p><p>aemil. You haue little cause to say so</p><p>Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of
doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens:
Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:
Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your
Beds</p><p>Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer</p><p>Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,
You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.
Aemil. You shall not write my praise</p></div> </div>
