I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,
Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:
I know our Country disposition well:
In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes
They dare not shew their Husbands.

And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,

To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,

I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much louing you</p><p>Oth. I am bound to thee for euer</p><p>Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:
