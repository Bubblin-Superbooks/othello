As if there were some Monster in thy thought
Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:
I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,
When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?
And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,
Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?
And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine
Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,
Shew me thy thought</p><p>Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Oth. I thinke thou do'st:

And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine,</p></div> </div>
